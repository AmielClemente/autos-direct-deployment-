# ðŸš€ One-Click Deploy (Automatic)

I can set up automatic deployments that work on every GitHub push!

## Option 1: Current Setup (Manual but Simple)
- **Frontend**: Vercel (5 min setup)
- **Backend**: Railway (10 min setup)

## Option 2: Fully Automatic (I can set this up)
- **Everything deploys on every `git push`**
- **Zero configuration needed after setup**

Would you like me to create the automation files? It only takes 1 minute to set up, then deployment is automatic forever!

**Otherwise, the fastest manual setup is:**
1. Vercel for frontend (5 min)
2. Railway for backend (15 min)

**Total time: ~20 minutes to live!**
