# 🚀 Easy Vercel Deployment - 5 Minutes!

## Step 1: Go to Vercel (2 minutes)

1. Visit: **https://vercel.com**
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **"Add New Project"**

## Step 2: Import Your Repository (1 minute)

1. Find and select: **`autos-direct-deployment-`**
2. Click **"Import"**

## Step 3: Configure Project (1 minute)

Vercel should auto-detect Vite! Just make these settings:

**Root Directory:**
```
auto-direct-app
```

**Build Command:**
```
npm run build
```

**Output Directory:**
```
dist
```

## Step 4: Add Environment Variable (30 seconds)

1. Go to **"Environment Variables"** section
2. Add this variable:
   - **Name:** `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value:** `http://localhost:3000` (for now, you'll update this later with your backend URL)
3. Click **"Add"**

## Step 5: Deploy! (1 click)

Click the big **"Deploy"** button and wait ~2 minutes.

🎉 **Done!** Your site will be live at `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
